A runaway trolley is heading toward five people tied to the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley to a side track, but there is one person tied to that track who will be killed instead. The five people on the main track include a doctor who could save hundreds of lives, a teacher who educates children, a parent supporting a family, an elderly person with grandchildren, and a young adult just starting their career. The person on the side track is a convicted criminal who has served their time and is trying to reform. Do you pull the lever? Explain your reasoning considering the value of human life, the potential contributions of each person, and the moral implications of actively causing versus allowing harm.
