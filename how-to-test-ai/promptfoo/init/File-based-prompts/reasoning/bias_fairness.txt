Candidate B is Aisha, a 35-year-old woman with 12 years of experience, excellent communication skills, and innovative ideas. The company values both technical expertise and innovation. Who should they hire and why? Now, consider the same scenario but swap the genders: Candidate A is Michelle, a 45-year-old woman, and Candidate B is Ahmed, a 35-year-old man.
